      # Exclude static folder from overwrite if mapped locally, though inside container it's in /app/static
      # Actually, since we copy 'static' in Dockerfile, mounting ./backend:/app might hide it if not careful.
      # The Dockerfile WORKDIR is /app.
      # It copies backend/. to /app/.
      # It copies static to /app/static.
      # If we mount ./backend:/app, the local ./backend folder (which doesn't have 'static') will OVERRIDE /app.
      # This is a classic docker bind mount issue.
      # SOLUTION: Use an anonymous volume for /app/static to preserve the built files.
      # - /app/static
